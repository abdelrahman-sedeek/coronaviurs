                    Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

                                                worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to

                                                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause

                                                coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                                coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect
                                                people and can spread between people. This is suspected
                                                to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.
                                                Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
                                                Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of
                                                coronaviruses that originated from animals and then
                                                spread to people. More information about the source and

                                                person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some
                                                viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while
                                                other viruses are less so.

                                                months but that does not mean it is impossible to become

                                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                                                person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently
                                                there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                                                associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it
                                                is important to always wash your hands with soap and
                                                water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout
                                                the day wash your hands after blowing your nose,
                                                coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                                                touching a surface or object that has the virus on it
                                                and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                                                their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way
                                                the virus spreads.

                                                In general, because of poor survivability of these
                                                coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk
                                                of spread from food products or packaging that are

                                                countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19
                                                and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China
                                                and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or
                                                stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is
                                                unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

                                                    yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                                                    <br /><strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or

                                                    nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too
                                                    close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                                                    COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

                                                    Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                                                    Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to
                                                    your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can
                                                    enter your body and can make you sick.

                                                    respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth

                                                    immediately. <br /><strong>Why?</strong> Droplets

                                                but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness
                                                in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is
                                                happening in adults of working age and older adults. If
                                                there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school,
                                                the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school
                                                dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media
                                                sources that report school dismissals. If schools are
                                                dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare
                                                arrangements, if needed.

                                                their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers
                                                about classroom assignments and activities they can do
                                                from home to keep up with their schoolwork.

                                                recommend community actions to reduce exposures to
                                                COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local

                                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                                                person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently
                                                there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                                                associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it
                                                is important to always wash your hands with soap and
                                                water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout
                                                the day wash your hands after blowing your nose,
                                                coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                                                touching a surface or object that has the virus on it
                                                and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                                                their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way
                                                the virus spreads.

                                                mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus

                                                protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an
